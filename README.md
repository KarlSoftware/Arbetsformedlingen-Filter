Arbetsformedlingen-Filter
================

Script is up and running with basic functionality once more after Arbetsf√∂rmedlingen completely re-worked their job-search design.

It is still a work in progress, re-releasing now with only the basic (main) functionality: custom hiding of uninteresting ads in search results based on your own criteria.

# Features

- Filter search results based on ad Title, Employer, Municipality, Publish-date
- Reset to default (empty) settings

## Not yet re-implemented

- Save & restore settings as text (easy to move between computers)
- Colour keywords inside of ads (quickly determine if an ad is especially dis/interesting)
