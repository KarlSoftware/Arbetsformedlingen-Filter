Arbetsformedlingen-Filter
================

Apply Post-Filters to the results of Swedish site Arbetsformedlingen.se to make up for lacking built-in filters.

Built-in support for Chrome and Firefox with
* Chrome TamperMonkey https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo
* Firefox GreaseMonkey https://addons.mozilla.org/sv-se/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/

Do your search, apply your filters and save them. Filters are saved on the computer, so they're still there next time!
You can also hide results individually, without making a certain filter for it. This is done by just pressing the X next to the result.
