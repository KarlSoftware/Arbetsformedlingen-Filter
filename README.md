Arbetsformedlingen-Filter
================

# To be continued

Since Arbetsf√∂rmedlingen has remade their entire website to dynamically add, change and move around data in a one-page-application style on their pages this script is going to need a big rewrite.

It will be updated with a new version as soon as it works close enough to the way it did before the changes of Platsbanken.
